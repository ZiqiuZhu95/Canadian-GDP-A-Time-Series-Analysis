# Time Series Analysis of Canadian GDP

This repository is my submission for a final project in my STAT443 - Forecasting Course using quarterly seasonally adjusted real GDP 1961Q1 - 2007Q1 . Accompanied with the submission includes the supplmentary code and data used to perform the analysis, as well as the project outline. 

The main source of reference for the analysis is found in Michael Sampson's Time Series Analysis book, of which a 2001 edition can be found [here](http://dsp-book.narod.ru/sampson_tsa.pdf). Albeit a bit unorganized in its raw form, the code can be utilized to reproduce the results shown on the PDF document for my analysis.
